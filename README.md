# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock

## Overview

This game was originally created by Sam Kass with Karen Bryla, and later reused in the TV show Big Bang Theory.

It is an expansion of the traditional Rock-Paper-Scissor game which greatly reduce the chances of ties.

## Rules

Based on Sheldon explanation, the rules are :
* Scissors cuts Paper
* Paper covers Rock
* Rock crushes Lizard
* Lizard poisons Spock
* Spock smashes Scissors
* Scissors decapitates Lizard
* Lizard eats Paper
* Paper disproves Spock
* Spock vaporizes Rock
* (and as it always has) Rock crushes Scissors
